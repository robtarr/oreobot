After much talk, and a lot of crazy ideas - this is the current iteration of my OreoBot. It's a combination of Node JS, an Arduino, Legos, and Oreos.

It's currently using Noduino, underneath a fluid instance of the website, connected to my OreoBot to deliver Oreos while I work.


## Make it work
1. Build an Arduino powered Oreo robot
2. $ node srv.web.js
3. Eat your Oreos

### This is only the beginning...
